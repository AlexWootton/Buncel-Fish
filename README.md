# Buncel-Fish

### Numero Uno Universal Translator

It's *basically* perfect

#### Installation and execution

- Download and extract into it's own folder
- From your favourite CLI or Terminal with Python installed (OS X has this by default) `cd` to the directory containing `buncel-fish.py`
- Run `python buncel-fish.py`
- Enjoy!

#### Additional Info

To add custom words, copy `default_dict.csv` to a new file called `custom_dict.csv` in the same folder and make alterations to that file.

When adding/removing/altering words be sure to follow the CSV conventions within

**DO NOT** change the first line of the CSV. This is used to identify the languages and the program will not work if the names are incorrect or improperly formatted
